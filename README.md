This is a list of ideas for Xue

* Look for differential usage of exons in singletons and duplicates and on sex chr and autosomes using this approach:

* Examine allele specific expression in the X. borealis, X. mello, and X. laevis crosses in the sex chromosomes and autosomes.
** collection of XB is in progress
** not sure if we have RNAlater preserved tissue from X. mello cross
** can still collect XL RNA data from a cross.
** Xue could also generate her own cross.
