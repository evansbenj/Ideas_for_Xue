# Ideas_for_Xue

This is a list of ideas for Xue

* Look for differential usage of exons in singletons and duplicates and on sex chr and autosomes using this approach:

   * This could be done with the X. mellotrop data, and integrated with the assessment of the region of suppressed recombination using the GBS data.
   * This could also be done with the new X. boreals data.

* Examine allele specific expression in the X. borealis, X. mello, and X. laevis crosses in the sex chromosomes and autosomes.
    * collection of XB is in progress
    * not sure if we have RNAlater preserved tissue from X. mello cross
    * can still collect XL RNA data from a cross.
    * Xue could also generate her own cross.
