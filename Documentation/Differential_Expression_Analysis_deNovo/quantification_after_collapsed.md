2. go through the transcriptome and extract only the transcript that is mapped
3. redo the quantification with the mapped transcripts
4. collapse the raw count
5. run DE

**collect transcript ID of the mapped transcripts**

```



**extract sequence of the mapped transcripts**

**quantification**

**collapse the raw count**
