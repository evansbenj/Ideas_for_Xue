# Examining the genomic location of DE transcripts 
When I tried to identify orthologs for borealis DE transcripts, I can only identify orthologs for 10%-25% of the DE transcripts depends on the approachs that I was using. It is odd that so few of them have orthologs in laevis. So I want to examin the DE transcripts themselves and see whether it is due to incorrect assembly.

# Examining the DE_laevis_genome_blastout
The questions that I am interest in looking at is 
  - did transcripts got assembled corrrectly?
  - how many of them were assembled with parts from L&S?
  - Take the one that assembled correctly, extract their genomic location (include all exons, not just hte tophit)

To answer the first question, I run the perl script that I developped for my undergraduate thesis with the DE_laevis_genome_blastout
