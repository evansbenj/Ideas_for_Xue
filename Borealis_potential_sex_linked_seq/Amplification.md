# Amplifying the Potential Sex linked Transcript Sequence
Plan: use the primer to amplify the sequence in genome sample first, then try to amplify the transcript in cDNA sample. 
location of cDNA sample: in the -20 fridge, box label - borealise cross tapole male and female; tube label - cDNA mesenih
