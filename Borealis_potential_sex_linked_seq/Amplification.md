# Amplifying the Potential Sex linked Transcript Sequence
This transcript sequence was found only in female tapole, not in male adult. 
Plan
- order 2 set of reverse primers and 2 set of forward primers -> 4 combination
- use the primer to amplify the sequence in genome sample first, then try to amplify the transcript in cDNA sample. 
- location of cDNA sample: in the -20 fridge, box label - borealise cross tapole male and female; tube label - cDNA mesenih
