# Ideas for Xue for M.Sc. work

Previous discussions with Xue about her upcomming M.Sc. work centered on using X. laevis to test for evidence of dosage compensation in amphibians. Ben Furman and I both realized that X. borealis would be a much better candidate to do this with because the region of suppressed recombination in X. borealis is much larger than in X. laevis.  So there should be many more genes to explore.

To this end we did RNAseq on liver tissue from a mother, a father, three daughters and three sons. These were multiplexed over at least two lanes (BenF can confirm). The point of doing this with a family is that we should be able to identify SNPs on the W and Z of the mother and distinguish the level of expression of each allele in the daughters and compare them individually to the Z alleles in the sons.

# Collaborative nature of the project

This work will be a collaborative project that crucially involves BenF and both builds on and depends on the discoveries he made during his Ph.D. thesis work.  BenF will contribute to various aspects of this project as he wishes, and the division of labour will likely be a work in progress as the project goes on.

# Questions for Ben:
* Did we do the RNAseq on the smae individuals for which we have WGS data?
* Did we do the RNAseq on only liver tissue or did we also include gonad?

# Main Directions 

* One could test whether the overall expression level of the nonPAR alleles in the mother and daughters is similar to that in the father and sons.

* One could test in the mother, whether the expression level of the W allele differs from the Z allele, and whether each of these differs from the Z allele in the sons and father.

* We could test whther, in non-PAR sex linked genes, expression divergence between the sexes (the magnitude of expression divergence) tends to be more pronounced compared to the autosomes. The prediction if this region is a warehouse for genes with sexually antagonistic function is that there should be more sex biased expression divergence (even on Z alleles after controlling for copy number) than the autosomes.

* we could also do more detailed analysis of molecular evolution and splicing (which is the focus of the work the Xue did for her undergrad thesis).

# Pros and Cons

One of the neat aspects of doing this in Xenopus borealis is that all of these comparisons can be done in tandem with analysis of the homeologous genes on chromosome 8S, which is not sex-linked.

A challenge, I think, may be to ensure that we can distinguish between the homeologs on 8L and 8S with very high confidence.
