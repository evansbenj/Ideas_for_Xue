#GMAP
I ran gmap indexing and wanted to document some of its output while doing indexing.
```
cd 
gmap_build -d db_gmap_laevisUnigene -D /home/xue/genome_data/laevis_genome/ -g Xl.seq.uniq.gz
```
Output:
```
Don't recognize character R at position 1020909.  Using N instead
Indexing offsets of oligomers in genome db_gmap_laevisUnigene (15 bp every 3 bp)
```
